The goal of this assignment is to understand and compare three automated unit test generation approaches—EvoSuite, Randoop, and ChatGPT—in terms of their effectiveness, strengths, and limitations.

You need to perform the following steps for the Java code mentioned below:
1. Use EvoSuite to automatically generate unit tests for the project.
2. Use Randoop to do the same.
3. Use ChatGPT to generate a set of unit test cases for the same project.
• Run all three sets of generated tests.
• Measure and report code coverage (statement, branch, and method coverage).
• You may use tools such as JaCoCo, EclEmma, Clover or IntelliJ coverage reports.
